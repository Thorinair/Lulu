# Lulu
Lulu is an ESP8266 powered "bridge" for connecting a MindFlex EEG headset with [Princess Luna](https://github.com/Thorinair/Princess-Luna). The device is battery powered and meant to be kept in a pocket while it reads serial data streamed from the MindFlex headset. This data is then translated to a more easily readable format and sent to Princess Luna for further processing, logging, graphing, etc.
